#Streaming App

To initiate the app, you must first run the python script using the command: 

python streamapp.py

Once you get the app to work locally, then run the following command:

ngrok http --region=us --hostname=manasanetcentricproject.ngrok.io 5000

This exposes the camera to the online users....showing your live feed.

You can view the app working on the heroku link where you hosted the code:
